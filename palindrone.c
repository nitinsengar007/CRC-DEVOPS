I'm learning the branching concept in Devops.
  branching is the process can be done by a developer to dont directly add any changes in the main branch first they can add new branh and then send pull/review request 
  to any person for reviewing the changes.
onces the changes is done then if the branch is delete then the other branch is store the same data cannot be delete.
